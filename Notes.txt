Hello everybody!
I am trying to creatre a file for the purpose of testing out GIT
I know Git is super commonly used, in fact, the interviewers asked about it when I applied for the CS position over the summer.
I can see how working collaboritively would be useful is a CS class.
I can also see how it might be a useful place for students to display their work.

I bet this will also be a great way for my students to be able to download assets for their projects.

Something I am concerned about is that writitng descriptions for each change seems tedious.
I worry that I will stop doing it on what I view as small changes and eventually stop doing it on big changes as well much like the way I comment my code. 

I hope using GIT helps me to comment and describe changes and code more consistently bewcause I definitely see the appeal.

huh no spell check, I wonder if there is a plug in for that that I can turn on and off.
