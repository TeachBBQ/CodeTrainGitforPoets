Hello everybody!
I am trying to creatre a file for the purpose of testing out GIT
I know Git is super commonly used, infact, they interviewers asked about it when I applied for the CS position over the summer.
I can see how working collaboritively would be useful is a CS class
I can also see how it might be a useful place for students to turn in their work.
